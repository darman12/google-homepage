# The Odin Project - Notes

These notes are for bits of information that stand out to me as I go through The Odin Project courses and are by no means comprehensive. They're tidbits that I find surprising and/or particularly important to remember and that I didn't already know.

##  Javascript
**Equality vs Strict Equality** comparison operators  
== Equality  
=== Strict Equality  

Strict equality checks that the variables have equal values and are of the same type. Equality only checks that the values are equal and do not check that the types are equal.

### Numbers
There are only two types for numbers. **Number** and **BigInt**.  

**Number** handles numbers of all sorts such as integers, floats and doubles which are handled by separate types in other languages. **BigInt** is for really long numbers.[^1]
